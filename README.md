# Overview

The mission with this project was to learn web scraping methods to extract information from the NASA Science Mars Exploration website using Chrome Developer tools to identify HTML components, Beautiful Soup/Splinter to automate a web browser and perform the scrape, MongoDB to store the data, and finally Flask to create a web application to display the data. Through the process, the goal was to develop an appt to scrape the following information about the planet Mars:

Images of the hemispheres


Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Titles and Previews Text from Mars
Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data with depenedncies such as web scraping, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Extra: A written report on the employee database analysis README.md.


# Goal

Use BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas to scrape five different webpages related to Mars, and display the results on a webpage using MongoDB and Flask.


# Conclusion

After all the code was checked, it was then transferred from the notebook to a Python file and used to create a scraping function. The results of all the scraping was then stored as a dictionary to be returned at the end of the function.
